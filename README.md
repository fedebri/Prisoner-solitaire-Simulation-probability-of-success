# Prisoner-solitaire-Simulation-probability-of-success

## I spent more than 4 hours with friends tryin to complete this
## preatty dull solitaire and then we wondered what the 
## probability of success is.
## This solitaire works as follows: as you show sequentially the 
## cards of the shuffled deck you call 1, 2 and 3
## Whenever a card of the same value called is showed the
## player loses. If the end of the deck is reached without ever
## matching the value called with the value of the card showed,
## the player wins.

## The deck is made up with 40 cards, divided into 4 suits each
## consisting of 10 cards whose values range from 1 to 10
## Wins are stored in a dictioonary as 'O', losses as 'X'
## The deck is initialized as a list
