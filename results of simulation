After running simGames(carte, 10000000) I obtained this values
{'O': 83437, 'X': 9916563}
which yields a probability of success of 0.0083437 with average number 
of trials needed to obtain a success of approximately 119

The probability of success slightly increases as the number of simulations increases.

This result is coherent with calculation performed in this blog [in italian], though the follow
a completely different different path to solve this problem
